# timer

Demonstration of a simple, command line timer in Python.  Makes use of a [thread pool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) and a [priority que](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html).

## Use

```python
python timer.py --timer 20 --sayings 5
```

## Background

This repo is intended to be used as an actual timer but also serves as an experiment in utilizing [PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer) to build a Python application.
