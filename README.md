# timer

Demonstration of a simple, command line timer in Python.  Makes use of a [quee](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque).

## Use

```sh
python timer.py --timer 20 --unit seconds
```

## Background

This repo is intended to be used as an actual timer but also serves as an experiment in utilizing [PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer) to build a Python application.
